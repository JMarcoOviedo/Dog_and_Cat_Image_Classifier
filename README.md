Data Science Project using Deep Learning for Image Classification

For this project, I built a Convolution Neural Network to identify whether an image was of a dog or a cat. This could be useful if Animal Control Services need to identify what kind of animal they would be dealing with. This would be more beneficial for security camera footage that may not have as high of a resolution as phone cameras. 

I was able to get the model to 84% accuracy after constructing the CNN which may be increased with additional training data.
